pycodestyle - Python style guide checker
===============================================================

pycodestyle is a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in `PEP 8`.

PEP 8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/


Features
--------

* Plugin architecture: Adding new checks is easy.

* Parseable output: Jump to error location in your editor.

* Small: Just one Python file, requires only stdlib. You can use just the ``pycodestyle.py`` file for this purpose.

* Comes with a comprehensive test suite.


Installation
------------

You can install, upgrade, and uninstall ``pycodestyle.py`` with these commands::

  $ pip install pycodestyle
  $ pip install --upgrade pycodestyle
  $ pip uninstall pycodestyle

There's also a package for Debian/Ubuntu, but it's not always the latest version.
